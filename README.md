# Node

## Setupx

* Use createNode to make a copy of 000-Node
* Change the name of the directory. E.g. 001-project.
* Go to the directory
* Click on ztart.bat
  * VS Code starts.
* View | Output - Run On Save
* View | Appearance | Toggle Side Bar (Ctrl+B)
* View | Appearance | Toggle Panel (Ctrl+J)
* View | Appearance | Toggle Panel Position

## Loop

* Edit 
* Save with ctrl+S

## Quirks

* Sometimes you need to touch the file to make Run On Save execute.
* Output Tasks must be set to Run On Save manually.
* ztart.bat is actually not needed. Use *Git Bash Here* instead
