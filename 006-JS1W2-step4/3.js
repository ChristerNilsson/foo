// 15.Write some code to test two arrays for equality using == and ===. Test the following:
// What do you think will happen with x == y, x === y and z == y and z == x? Prove it!

// MY COMMENT: This has to be a recursive function.

// 16. Take a look at the following code:
let o1 = { foo: "bar" }
let o2 = { foo: "bar" }
let o3 = o2;
// Show that changing o2 changes o3 (or not) 
o2.foo = 'crap'
assert('crap', o3.foo)
// Show that changing o1 changes o3 (or not).
o1.foo = 'quack'
assert('crap', o3.foo)

// Does the order that you assign (o3 = o2 or o2 = o3) matter?

// 17. What does the following code return? (And why?)
let bar = 42;
assert('string', typeof typeof bar)

print('###################')
